# 1) Check the data type of our date column
# You'll be working with the "Date" column from the earthquakes dataframe. Investigate this column now: does it look like it contains dates? What is the dtype of the column?

# TODO: Your code here!
earthquakes['Date'].dtype


# 2) Convert our date columns to datetime
# Most of the entries in the "Date" column follow the same format: "month/day/four-digit year". However, the entry at index 3378 follows a completely different pattern. Run the code cell below to see this.
earthquakes[3378:3383]

# This does appear to be an issue with data entry: ideally, all entries in the column have the same format. We can get an idea of how widespread this issue is by checking the length of each entry in the "Date" column.
date_lengths = earthquakes.Date.str.len()
date_lengths.value_counts()

# Looks like there are two more rows that has a date in a different format. Run the code cell below to obtain the indices corresponding to those rows and print the data.
indices = np.where([date_lengths == 24])[1]
print('Indices with corrupted data:', indices)
earthquakes.loc[indices]

# Given all of this information, it's your turn to create a new column "date_parsed" in the earthquakes dataset that has correctly parsed dates in it.
# TODO: Your code here
earthquakes.loc[3378, 'Date'] = "02/23/1975"
earthquakes.loc[7512, 'Date'] = "04/28/1985"
earthquakes.loc[20650, 'Date'] = "03/13/2011"
earthquakes['date_parsed'] = pd.to_datetime(earthquakes['Date'], format = "%m/%d/%Y")


# 3) Select the day of the month
# Create a Pandas Series day_of_month_earthquakes containing the day of the month from the "date_parsed" column.
# try to get the day of the month from the date column
day_of_month_earthquakes = earthquakes['date_parsed'].dt.day


# 4) Plot the day of the month to check the date parsing
# Plot the days of the month from your earthquake dataset.
# TODO: Your code here!
day_of_month_earthquakes = day_of_month_earthquakes.dropna()
sns.distplot(day_of_month_earthquakes, kde = False, bins = 31)
